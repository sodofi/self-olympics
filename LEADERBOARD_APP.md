## Design Principles Applied

âœ… Raw and structural layout with visible borders  
âœ… Big color blocks and sharp edges  
âœ… Typography as a core visual element  
âœ… High-contrast palette with no soft pastels  
âœ… Bold color inversions on interactive elements  
âœ… Asymmetric spacing with vast negative space  
âœ… Poster-like screens where color and type ARE the interface  
âœ… Unpolished, striking, unapologetic tone
